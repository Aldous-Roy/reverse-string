## Introduction

The `ReverseStringInPlace` program is designed to reverse a string represented as a character array in Java. The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, where the characters at the start and end of the array are swapped, moving inward, until the entire string is reversed.

## Features

- Reverses an array of characters in-place.
- Uses O(1) extra memory.
- Efficient O(n) time complexity.
